                        <p class="cont-sec">Digital marketing refers to the use of digital channels, such as search engines, social media, email, mobile apps, and other online platforms, to promote products or services and to connect with potential customers. It involves a range of tactics and strategies, including search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, social media marketing, email marketing, content marketing, influencer marketing, and more. Digital marketing has become increasingly important in recent years as more and more people rely on the internet for information and as online commerce continues to grow. Effective digital marketing requires a deep understanding of the target audience, a well-defined marketing strategy, and the ability to use analytics and other tools to track and optimize campaigns for maximum impact.</p>

                        <p class="cont-sec">Promoting a company’s goods or services in a way that strengthens the brand as a whole is known as brand marketing. It entails developing and upholding relationships between a brand and its customers as well as marketing brand attributes, or the characteristics that come to mind when someone thinks of a specific brand. We’ll cover a broad range of topics related to branding in this book, including brand marketing strategy, brand types, brand equity, brand relevance, and brand recognition. We’ll also highlight branding options offered by Amazon Ads.</p>

                        <p class="cont-sec">By promoting other people’s items through affiliate marketing, you can earn a modest commission on each sale. On many of the websites you frequent, there are certainly headlines labelled “affiliate link” or “sponsored post.” Or, perhaps you’ve already taken the initiative and registered with an affiliate network.In the context of advertising, affiliate marketing refers to the practise of paying outside publications to direct customers to a company’s goods and services. The commission payment encourages the affiliate third-party publishers to look for ways to advertise the business.</p>

                        <p class="cont-sec">Referral marketing is the method of promoting products or services to new customers through referrals, usually word of mouth. It’s a comprehensive strategy to encourage passionate customers and brand advocates to directly refer their inner network to your business. Such referrals often happen spontaneously but businesses can influence this through appropriate strategies.Word-of-mouth marketing and referral marketing appear to be similar, but they differ significantly. Referral marketing is more “intentional” than word-of-mouth marketing, which is the main distinction between the two. A company starts a referral marketing campaign on purpose. Businesses that use referral marketing actively urge their consumers to recommend them to their friends. Wordof- mouth advertising can be more impulsive and is frequently launched by satisfied customers rather than by the brand on purpose.</p>
